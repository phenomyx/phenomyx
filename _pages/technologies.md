  <ul style='line-height: 1.7em; margin-bottom:25px'>  
   <li> The LabEmbryoCam is tailored towards repeated long term intensive imaging of small samples - be this embryos, motile organisms or anything else typically cultured in a multiwell plate.</li>
   <li>The LabEmbryoCam is a highly-modular and self-contained bioimaging instrument for scanning multiwell plates. It is tailored towards repeated long term intensive imaging of small samples - be this embryos, motile organisms or anything else typically cultured in a multiwell plate.</li>
   <li>As with all of our technologies - it is opensource - so producing one yourself is entirely possible. However, so too is buying one from us - if you lack the time, skills or resource.</li> 
   <li>We rely heavily on 3D printing - enabling rapid manufacture, and modification of our technologies - increasing their versatility and relevance to different applications.</li>
   <li>Phenomyx have supplied LabEmbryoCams both nationally and internationally, and have even shipped one to a remote island in the Indian Ocean for a field trip.</li>
   <li>The LabEmbryoCam is a stalwart of the EmbryoPhenomics resaerch group's research - so reach out to hear more about if it might be relevant for you.</li>

## Field instruments

<ul style='line-height: 1.7em; margin-bottom:25px'>  
   <li> Measuring biology out in the environment is a central component of what the EmbryoPhenomics Research Group do.</li>
   <li>The technologies to do so - in our experience, do not exist on the shelf.</li>
   <li>Consequently we make them. From underwater cameras for fish, to underwater cameras for embryos, or barnacles.</li> 
   <li>Watch this space to see our most recent innovation - the PebbleCam - a low cost and easy to use submersible camera system for a broad range of sample types.</li>
   <li>Not just a tool for research - but education and outreach to. Find one in a rockpool near you during Spring/Summer 2025.</li>

## Image analysis pipelines

<ul style='line-height: 1.7em; margin-bottom:25px'>  
   <li> Acquiring video is a key part of the challenge to phenomics research - but without effective image analysis you simply have a collection of images</li>
   <li> Image analysis pipelines are crucially important. We have a broad catalogue of pipelines for different applications - that are highly transferrable and accessible. </li>
